<hr/>

Blitz Wallet is a React Native application that allows users to interact with the Bitcoin Lighting Network in a self-custodial way. Combining Breez, Boltz, and Blockstream, Blitz Wallet aims to create a seamless and simple payment experience for its users.

<hr>

⚠️ This is a SELF-CUSTODIAL Bitcoin Lightning wallet. Neither Blitz, Boltz, or Blockstream has access to your seed phrase or funds. If you lose your seed phrase, access to your funds will be lost. Also, do not share your seed phrase with anyone. If you do, they will be able to steal your funds.
